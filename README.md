Step 1. To get started, copy the scripts directory to the /root/ directory. 

Step 2. Browse to /root/scripts/3-weaponry/attacks/exploits/bof/build/ and launch start.sh

Step 3. Follow the direction on screen.
Note: All of the content is copied from the template directory and placed in the live directory.

Step 4. Once the start.sh steps have been completed navigate to: /root/scripts/3-weaponry/attacks/exploits/bof/live/ and then open up the new folder that has the IP Address and port number you provided for the target.

Step 5. If you know how many bytes it takes to overflow the buffer start with phase-01*

Step 6. Once shellcode is generated in phase-10* you have to manually copy this shellcode which is found in a file called shellcode in the same working directory. Copy the shellcode and paste it in the shellcode section of phase-12*

Step 7. Before running phase-11* I recommend openging another terminal window to run just phase-11* as this will be your handler.
